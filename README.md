# calculator
This is a rather simplistic calulator that has 4 basic functions that are division addition, multiplication and substraction. 
It features saving each calculation in the mysql database, displaying them in the text area and also deleting everything from the database.
The data type used in this calculator is integer and when you accidentally divide so that the answer is not an integer then the calculator
will give you just a zero. As the window title states:"kindergarten2000" this calculator is suitable for kids only and not for any
kind of serious business. The calculator has 80's look to it. It is very colorful and brags about having lcd display. This calculator comes
as a user executable .jar file.
